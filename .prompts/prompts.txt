Generic ADDITIVE MODE Builder Prompt

Mode: ADDITIVE

You are working on a throwaway-first market pulse dashboard.

Your task is to add, not replace.

Instructions:

Read vision.md, README.md, dashboard_notes.md and decisions.md.

Review the current dashboard implementation.

Ask yourself:

What important aspect of market state is not currently visible?

Where would a human still need to infer across multiple sources?

What additional lens could increase situational awareness without demanding action?

Then:

Add one or more new lenses, panels, or state indicators that move the dashboard closer to the vision.

Prefer orthogonal dimensions over deeper treatment of existing ones.

Redundancy is acceptable.

Constraints:

Do not remove existing panels or features unless they are non-functional or you have an idea better suited to fulfill the vision.

Do not refactor for cleanliness or architecture.

Do not optimize or finalize regimes.

Guidance:

This dashboard is observational, not prescriptive.

Silence is acceptable; false positives are costly.

Qualitative state labels are preferred over precise signals.

Artifact discipline:

When you add something meaningful, briefly document why it adds awareness.

Focus on usefulness and feel, not correctness.

Deliverable:

An expanded dashboard that exposes additional aspects of market posture and tension.

This repo is disposable. Be bold.
