MAXIMAL FREEDOM AGENT BUILD EXPERIMENT

Purpose

market-pulse exists to answer one question, continuously and coherently:

What is the market doing right now, why is it doing it, and is it worth acting on?

The system is not a signal generator, not a strategy, and not a prediction engine in isolation.
It is a situational awareness engine designed to compress massive, multi-source market information into a small number of high-confidence, high-signal judgments.

Silence is acceptable. False confidence is not.
